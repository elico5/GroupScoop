# GroupScoop

## Overview

GroupScoop is an interactive data visualization tool for users of the GroupMe application to examine activity statistics from group chats they are a part of. 

## Functionality & MVPs:

In GroupScoop, users will be able to: 
* Enter their personal GroupMe access token (available at https://dev.groupme.com/) to grant the app access to the GroupMe API
* Select a group to request data and statistics from
* View total statistics on their group chats (total number of messages, etc.)
* View statistics for specific members of the group chat (total number of messages, total likes received, total likes given out, nicknames or aliases used, most liked messages, etc.)

In addition, this project will include:
* The ability to pause API calls and analyze data as generated a certain amount of time into the past (taken from present time)
* The ability to download a PDF printout detailing the data gathered from a specific group

## Libraries & Technology

* The GroupMe API for data collection
* The D3 JavaScript library for data visualization
